<P>
I am sorry if i made you sad or mad. I couldn't wish for another family.
 I just have one thing that you can help with. 
 The thing is that for you two to stop shouting and spend time with me and David. 
 Also please tell David to stop fighting with me and to play with me like I try to do because everytime I try to play or a misunderstanding happens he just starts hitting.
From your 1 and only, Steven.
